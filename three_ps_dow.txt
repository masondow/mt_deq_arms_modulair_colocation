Week 5 - 2/21/25 Update

Progress: The final two colocated Modulair sensors were installed this week, completing this portion of the project. I also worked on updating my data Modulair data retrieval script this week. More to come this weekend. 

Problems: Right now I am having trouble bouncing between ym work and home computers and keeping everything synched across both--last week I missed pushing my 3P's update because of this, pulling the update onto my work computer and not realizing I hadn't pushed that final piece from my home computer.

Additionally, I am having the feeling that I am not properly structuring my virtual environment properly between the two. I just tried to redo this but failed, and my dependencies aren't showing up where I need them to. 

Plans: I plan to get my data retrieval script (pivoted from R to python after reviewing the command-line-interface package from QuantAQ, which only exists as a Python script) for pulling data from the Modulair unit this weekend. I can then update my SQL script to pull the data from our local SQL server via our in-house AVconn package, which I need to update. Some data combining may need to happen by hand in excel, as there may be a 3rd data source I need which would come directly from one our our direct-poll samplers at our local Rossiter site. No coding to access this unit, rather manufacturer-specific software for data retrieval. 

Hours: Including travel for sensor installation, 15 this week.

Week 4 - 2/14/25 Update

Progress: Worked on updating my folder structure for my repo this week.

Problems: Main problem I can see arising is figuring out how I want my data retrieval script to be structured in order to accommodate future data polls with more parameters than PM2.5, how to set a primary dependent variable. 

Plans: Installing the final two collocated Modulair sensors in the middle of next week on a large QC loop across western MT, in Missoula and Libby. 

Hours: 4 this week.

Week 3 - 2/10/25 Update

Progress: Not a huge update as of this week--regulatory QA work usually consumers the first half of my month. I am installing my final two Modulair PM2.5 collocation sensors in Missoula and Libby next week--they will be added to my final dataset after they run for a week at these sites, for the purposes of simply nominally expanding the number of independent observations in the dataset and make for a prettier map for some of my presentation graphics (covering more of Montana). Given the brevity of their data collection for use in this initial analysis and model run, they are much more for inclusion in the dataset after the coming smoke season, after which these pairings will exhibit a much larger range of observed measurements. 

Problems: My main problem this week is trying to set aside enough time in February to actually do my model training and assessment!

Plans: Spoke mostly about my coming plans in the Progress portion. Cant believe we're almost halfway done with Feb!

Hours: Maybe 15 this week given that I spent some time doing some network planning for our DEQ section, which included refining my timeline for deploying additional Modulair collocated pairs this week.

Week 2 - 2/2/25 Update

Progress: In the last week I have confirmed with Andrew a winnowing of scope of the project. Namely, I will be developing my Modulair to FEM comparison and modeled correction factors based on a more limited collocated dataset, with this effort serving as a "proof of concept" project that forms the pillar of the more robust collocation modeling to come when more PM2.5 sites are online and have collected a wider range of concentration hours than the existing dataset (as well as for gasses).

Problems: One problem I worked through with Andrew this week was figuring out how to take an average of paired FEM measurements in order to derive a single dependent variable. It seems the cubed-root of the inverse variance share of each sampler are a mathematically viable way to apply weights to the different FEM samples to come up with a single FEM dependent value. 

Plans: I need to refine my code to query my two databases, the Modulair cloud database via their API and Python wrapper, as well as my SQL code to query our AirVision SQL Server, to be as mutable as possible, such that I have functions with easily adjustable start/end dates that extract and transform my data cleanly into a single dataset for analysis and modeling. 

Hours: Maybe 15 this week given that I spent some time doing some network planning for our DEQ section, which included refining my timeline for deploying additional Modulair collocated pairs this week.

Week 1 - 1/24/25 Update

Progress: Since the end of the fall semester I have made more progress in prioritizing the colocation priority list and timeline for our Modulair sensor deployments.

Problems: My main problem I can see arising is having too small a sample size of colocated sensors with our regulatory monitors, leaving me with too narrow a dataset for developing a robust model and correction factors for the wide range of PM2.5 concentrations our monitors can see over the course of a year. 

Plans: My plan, as of now, is to use this capstone project to serve as the pillar/proof of concept for future colocation analysis and correction that will span more monitors over a longer period of time. To do so, I will want to make my code (from data gathering, cleaning, analysis and model development and deployment) as reproducible as possible (i.e. lots of functions essentially). To do this I should get better at writing clean, lightweight, deployable functions in R and Python!
