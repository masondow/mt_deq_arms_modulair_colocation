Week 1 - 1/24/25 Update

Progress: Since the end of the fall semester I have made more progress in prioritizing the colocation priority list and timeline for our Modulair sensor deployments.

Problems: My main problem I can see arising is having too small a sample size of colocated sensors with our regulatory monitors, leaving me with too narrow a dataset for developing a robust model and correction factors for the wide range of PM2.5 concentrations our monitors can see over the course of a year. 

Plans: My plan, as of now, is to use this capstone project to serve as the pillar/proof of concept for future colocation analysis and correction that will span more monitors over a longer period of time. To do so, I will want to make my code (from data gathering, cleaning, analysis and model development and deployment) as reproducible as possible (i.e. lots of functions essentially). To do this I should get better at writing clean, lightweight, deployable functions in R and Python!

Week 2 - 2/2/25 Update

Progress: In the last week I have confirmed with Andrew a winnowing of scope of the project. Namely, I will be developing my Modulair to FEM comparison and modeled correction factors based on a more limited collocated dataset, with this effort serving as a "proof of concept" project that forms the pillar of the more robust collocation modeling to come when more PM2.5 sites are online and have collected a wider range of concentration hours than the existing dataset (as well as for gasses).

Problems: One problem I worked through with Andrew this week was figuring out how to take an average of paired FEM measurements in order to derive a single dependent variable. It seems the cubed-root of the inverse variance share of each sampler are a mathematically viable way to apply weights to the different FEM samples to come up with a single FEM dependent value. 

Plans: I need to refine my code to query my two databases, the Modulair cloud database via their API and Python wrapper, as well as my SQL code to query our AirVision SQL Server, to be as mutable as possible, such that I have functions with easily adjustable start/end dates that extract and transform my data cleanly into a single dataset for analysis and modeling. 

Hours: Maybe 15 this week given that I spent some time doing some network planning for our DEQ section, which included refining my timeline for deploying additional Modulair collocated pairs this week.
